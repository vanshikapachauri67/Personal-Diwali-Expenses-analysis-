## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset used in this project is a **self-collected personal finance dataset**, consisting of income and expense transactions recorded during Diwali seasons for 2024 and 2025.

It includes details such as:
- Date of transaction  
- Category (Income / Expense)  
- Source of income or expense  
- Item description and item category (Food, Clothing, etc.)  
- Payment method  
- Planned budget and target savings  

This structured dataset allowed for powerful **data modeling, DAX-based calculations, and visualization** of personal finance trends.
